        KPLIB_whitelist_cmdrSlot = [
            "123445245",
            "235245345",
            "456454443"
        ];
*/

// Access to the commander slot.
KPLIB_whitelist_cmdrSlot = [

];

// Access the commander actions (rights, production, etc.), even if the corresponding player is not in the commander slot.
KPLIB_whitelist_cmdrActions = [
            "76561199062959583",   
            "76561198196083931",
